USC-ObjectsNegotiationTask
==========================
Objects Negotiation Task (Dehghani, Carnevale & Gratch, 2014) is a web-based multi-round negotiation task where a participant and a computer-agent can make a proposal in turn to negotiate items. Items are placed on a trading board initially, and participants can move items on the board into own possession or into opponent's possession by dragging and dropping the items. After each round, the player who received the proposal can choose either to accept the proposal or make a new proposal. Both the agent and the participant can express their emotional reaction using facial display during the game. This program is written in Java using GWT.

This task was developed jointly by Morteza Dehghani, Peter Carnevale and Jonathan Gratch, and its maintained by Eunkyung Kim. For more information about this task, please refer to this paper:
