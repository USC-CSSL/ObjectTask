//scenario_textA = <p>1Imagine the following hypothetical scenario:</p><p>There has been an earthquake in the town you live in and many have been injured. All roads to your town have been blocked and as a result aid is coming in very slowly. Because of this every family has to split packages of aid sent using helicopters with another family.</p><p>You and the family that have to split the aids with each other, both have babies who have been injured and have developed infections. The only way to control the spread of infection, which if not stopped will become lethal, is to use penicillin. You are also running low on food, but have enough clean water that would last you for several days. All the shops in the town are closed, so it is uncertain whether you can use the money to purchase goods.</p><p>Given the circumstances, you know that no other aid package will be received for another week. The aid packages include medicine including penicillin, canned food, some money and water bottles.</p><p>In the task that follows, you have to negotiate how these items have to be split between your family and the other household. You do not know how much food and water the other family has.</p><p>The negotiation is done in a sequence of alternating offers. You will make the first offer. The other negotiator may or may not accept your offer. If it does not accept it, that is, if it rejects your offer, it will send you a new offer. You can either accept or reject its offer. If you accept it, you will get to keep the items that you did not give them. If you reject their offer, you can make another offer and submit it to them. If after 12 rounds there is no agreement, the negotiation will end in no agreement.

scenario_symbolic = <style type="text/css">Label-style {font-family: Arial, sans-serif;font-size: 14px;}</style><Label-style>Imagine you work for the National Security Agency (NSA). The mission of the NSA is first, to protect sensitive and secret national security information from foreign espionage, second, to collect foreign signals to support military operations, and third, to defeat terrorists and their organizations. As a matter of principle, all operations need legal permission in order to be consistent with U.S. laws and the protection of privacy and civil liberties.<br><br>Having said this, you have witnessed that the NSA operates under principles that are not in accordance with U.S. laws and are therefore unconstitutional. The director of the NSA instructed you to engage in a global and indiscriminate mass-surveillance program. In addition to collecting the emails, text messages, and telephone calls of all American citizens, you are delegated to access and save data from online services like Google and Facebook, through a number of different platforms including smartphones, and Microsoft and Apple computers. This is done regardless of any existing suspect cases. You realize that these tasks defeat the purpose of the NSA\u2019s mission to protect American citizens from foreign attacks and rather fill the position of an indiscriminate surveillance program, which is in fact illegal. By obeying and executing these instructions, you become an accessory of illegal and unconstitutional operations. For these reasons you decide to disclose classified documents of the NSA, proving its felonious operations, to several media sources, with the aim of realizing a reform of the NSA\u2019s operation principles. The director of the NSA learns about your intentions and as a matter of prudence is willing to negotiate with you. Naturally, his aim is to stop you from revealing the secret information.<br><br>In the task that follows you have to negotiate with an opponent (taking the side of the Director of the NSA), about the future course of action. The negotiation matters focus on handing back the documents in return for (a) reforms of the unconstitutional operation principles or (b) a bonus payment.

scenario_democratic = <style type="text/css">Label-style {font-family: Arial, sans-serif;font-size: 14px;}</style><Label-style>Two bills were introduced to U. S. congressional committees in March and April 2013 to regulate current laws on immigration and gun control issues. One of these bills, the <b>Immigration Reform Bill</b> seeks to create a program to help the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U. S. gain legal status in conjunction with efforts to secure the border. Key amendments within the bill include: providing undocumented immigrants in the U.S. a pathway to citizenship, increasing the allocation of family and employment green cards, and adjusting the immigration status of illegal immigrants who entered the U.S. as minor children. Another bill, the <b>Gun Control Reform Bill</b>, seeks to protect children and communities by reducing gun violence. The bill aims to ban military style assault weapons and high capacity magazines, requires criminal background checks for all gun sales and creates serious punishments for gun trafficking. Both bills were introduced by members of the Democratic Party and failed to obtain the necessary votes in order to get enacted due to intense opposition by members of the Republican Party. Republicans hold conflicting interests with regard to both bills. They oppose the \u201Cpath to citizenship\u201D and would rather offer unauthorized immigrants work permits if, as stated in the Republican outline, <i>\u201Cthey were willing to admit their culpability, pass rigorous background checks, pay significant fines and back taxes, develop proficiency in English and American civics, and be able to support themselves and their families.\u201D</i> In regards to gun control reform, Republicans argue that the bill violates Second Amendment rights, which gives an individual the right to keep and bear arms for traditionally lawful purposes such as self-defense.
