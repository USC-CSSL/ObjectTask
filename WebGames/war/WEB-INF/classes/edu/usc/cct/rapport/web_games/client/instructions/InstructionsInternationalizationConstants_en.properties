textAreaInstructions = <p>Imagine the following hypothetical scenario:</p><p>There has been an earthquake in the town you live in and many have been injured. All roads to your town have been blocked and as a result aid is coming in very slowly. Because of this every family has to split packages of aid sent using helicopters with another family. You and the family that have to split the aid items with each other, both have babies who have been injured and have developed infections. The only way to control the spread of infection, which if not stopped will become lethal, is to use penicillin. You are also running low on food, but have enough clean water that would last you for several days. All the shops in the town are closed, so it is uncertain whether you can use the money to purchase goods. Given the circumstances, you know that no other aid package will be received for another week. The aid packages include medicine including penicillin, canned food, some money and water bottles.</p><p>In the task that follows, you have to negotiate how these items have to be split between your family and the other household. You do not know how much food and water the other family has.</p><p>The negotiation is done in a sequence of alternating offers. You will make the first offer. The other negotiator may or may not accept your offer. If it does not accept it, that is, if it rejects your offer, it will send you a new offer. You can either accept or reject its offer. If you accept it, you will get to keep the items that you did not give them. If you reject their offer, you can make another offer and submit it to them. If after 24 rounds there is no agreement, the negotiation will end in “no agreement.” In this case, you both will only receive one of each item and the rest will be given away.</p><p>Try to get as many items as you can. </p><p>Here are the icons representing the objects:</p><p>Medicine: <img src="http://emotions.usc.edu/group/images/Pills-MD.png" alt="Medicine" width="42" height="42" /></p><p>Water Bottles: <img src="http://emotions.usc.edu/group/images/Waterbottle-MD.png" alt="Water Bottles" width="42" height="42" /></p><p>Money: <img src="http://emotions.usc.edu/group/images/CashPic-MD.png" alt="Money" width="42" height="42" /></p><p>Food Cans: <img src="http://emotions.usc.edu/group/images/can-new.png" alt="Food Cans" width="42" height="42" /></p>
